You can find the repository for this project here: [htmx-clone](https://github.com/djmunro/htmx-clone).

## Overview

The primary intent of this project is to better understand how [htmx](https://htmx.org) works by implementing some of its basic functionality. HTMX allows you to access AJAX, WebSockets, and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, without needing to write any JavaScript. This project attempts to mimic some of the core features of HTMX to grasp its underlying mechanics.

## Features Implemented

- AJAX calls using data attributes
- Basic swapping of HTML content
- Handling various hx actions like hx-target and hx-swap
